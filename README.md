# TinyNotes
A super-simple, super-light, and super-customizable Ruby script to take timestamped notes with. Configured for MM/DD/YYYY 12:00 AM/PM.

## Example
Go to [basenotes.txt](basenotes.txt) to see a sample note. Of course, swap out the timestamp details as you wish!

## GUI
The Shoes app is required to run [napp.rb](napp.rb), which is the graphical user interface version of TinyNotes. It saves notes with only the end timestamp, and uses textboxes for easier editing. A "clear all" button is included too! Currently, the goal is to get a file selection button using a computer's native system working. There will be a package to bundle them both soon.
